# Setting-up-Linux
## Description
The sets I have taken to setup linux on my laptop.  They are mainly here to help me remember the exact commands that were required to either install new 'items' or fix problems.

* (Obvious) Download the iso for the desired distro.  ie Ubuntu
* Download 'rufus'.  This helps creating a bootable USB stick with the downloaded ISO.
